# pokedexSPA
Hey Guys!

This is my first SPA, where I've crafted a Pokedex with the assistance of https://pokeapi.co/.

Here are some commands to navigate through the Pokedex:

Click on 'A' to search for a Pokemon by its name.

Click on 'X', and buttons for the first 9 generations will appear.

Select a generation to load the respective Pokemon sprites. Once the loading is complete, you can scroll down and click on any sprite to visit the Pokemon's page.
Click on the "Home" button to return to the first page.

And if you click on 'A' or 'X' you'll return to the previously mentioned pages. 

I've incorporated several other buttons, and I have plans to add more features in the future. Currently, I'm engrossed in a Java backend project as I continue to learn and grow.

I hope you enjoy exploring the Pokedex!
